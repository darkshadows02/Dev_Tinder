--feed 
user should see all the user cards except
0. his own card
1. his connection
2. ignored pople
3. alredy sent the connection request

example :  rahul=[mark, donald, ms, virat]
rahul->akshay->rejected rahul->elon->accepted
initally all they r into list but when rahul accepted or rejected anything 
then it remove from the lis 
for example here elon=[mark, donald, ms, virat] all will come expect rahul
same for akshay 

--> list can contain only 10 user at a time so 
we r using pagination concept

/feed?page=1&limit=10 => 1-10 => .skip(0) & .limit(10)
/feed?page=2&limit=20 => 2-20 => .skip(10) & .limit(10)
/feed?page=3&limit=30 => 3-30 => .skip(20) & .limit(10)
